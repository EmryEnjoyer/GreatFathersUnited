            <p class="content">Great Fathers United aspires to be one of the leading self-reliance inner city youth programs in Tennessee for young men looking for a safe environment to become an effective leader in the community. To do this we are creating a safe, secure, self sustainable community for the families of future men. The reasources that we provide to members include shelter, energy, land, and food.</P>
           <p class="content">  We provide shelter through the help of our members building homes in the community and through an Amish partnership wherew cabins can be purchased with no credit check, no deposit, no closing cost, no site prep and free delivery. Energy will fuel the houses by using wind and solar energy that will be completely free. Land will be purchased by members who will divide it amoung the group. On this land we will have a community that will include features such as a walking trail, community park, work from home opportunities, and much more. Food will also be provided by raising livestock, a natural fishy, and organic garden. We are always looking for new members to join us to help us reach our vision. </p>
